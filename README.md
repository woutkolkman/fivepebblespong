### Doom part
You'll probably need a keyboard and mouse for this to properly work.  
1. Buy DOOM 1993 on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/2280/DOOM_1993/  
2. Download the latest DOOM Retro version: https://github.com/bradharding/doomretro/releases  
3. Extract the DOOM Retro .zip to "C:\Program Files\doomretro"  
4. Open the "doomretro.cfg" file and set "vid_fullscreen" off  
5. Run it once to check if everything works as expected, select the DOOM.WAD file from DOOM 1993 at startup.

### Description
A Rain World mod that adds a game controller to Five Pebbles' room. If slugcat grabs it, Pebbles invites you to play Pong. Controls are the up and down keys. This mod does not alter existing dialogue or behavior.
